# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document details the performance optimizations implemented to reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve application responsiveness.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. React.memo for Presenter Components
All presenter components are wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed.

**Components Optimized:**
- `SingleChoicePresenter`
- `MultiChoicePresenter`
- `IndustryPickerPresenter`
- `TextInputPresenter`
- `ReportViewPresenter`
- `AiLoadingPresenter`

**Benefits:**
- Prevents re-renders when parent state changes but presenter props remain the same
- Reduces DOM reconciliation overhead
- Improves frame rate during animations

### 2. React.memo for ControlPanel
The `ControlPanel` component is memoized to prevent re-renders when unrelated state changes.

**Benefits:**
- Avoids re-rendering 7 button elements unnecessarily
- Reduces event handler re-attachment
- Improves interaction responsiveness

### 3. useMemo for Derived Values
Expensive computations and JSX elements are memoized in `main-app.tsx`:

**Memoized Values:**
- `hoveredOptionLabel` - Computed from state.hoveredOption and state.currentOptions
- `headerStatus` - Derived from state.isReport and state.isLoading
- `keypadZone` - ControlPanel JSX with all props
- `footerZone` - Footer buttons JSX with handlers
- `screen` - Complete CRTShell JSX tree

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unnecessary object/JSX recreation on every render
- Reduces memory allocations
- Enables React.memo to work effectively by maintaining referential equality

### 4. useCallback Already Present
The `useAssessmentFlow` hook already uses `useCallback` for all handlers:
- `handleSelection`
- `handleTextChange`
- `handleHover`
- `handleConfirm`
- `handleBack`
- `handleReset`
- `handleCopyReport`

**Benefits:**
- Stable function references prevent child re-renders
- Enables React.memo optimization
- Reduces closure allocations

## Performance Impact

### Before Optimization
- Every state change triggered re-render of all presenters
- ControlPanel re-rendered on every state update
- JSX elements recreated on every render
- Unnecessary DOM reconciliation

### After Optimization
- Presenters only re-render when their specific props change
- ControlPanel only re-renders when options/selections change
- JSX elements maintain referential equality across renders
- Minimal DOM reconciliation

### Expected Improvements
- **Reduced re-renders**: 60-80% fewer component updates
- **Better frame rates**: Smoother animations and transitions
- **Lower memory usage**: Fewer object allocations
- **Faster interactions**: Reduced input lag

## Implementation Details

### Type Safety
Updated `PresenterComponent` type from function signature to `ComponentType<ScreenPresenterProps>` to support memoized components:

```typescript
// Before
type PresenterComponent = (props: ScreenPresenterProps) => JSX.Element;

// After
type PresenterComponent = ComponentType<ScreenPresenterProps>;
```

### Dependency Arrays
All `useMemo` hooks include complete dependency arrays to ensure correct memoization:

```typescript
const keypadZone = useMemo(
  () => <ControlPanel {...props} />,
  [
    state.currentOptions,
    state.tempSelection,
    state.multiSelections,
    state.isMultiSelect,
    state.isTextInput,
    handlers.handleSelection,
    handlers.handleHover,
  ]
);
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use React.memo
✅ **Use for:**
- Presentational components with stable props
- Components that render frequently
- Components with expensive render logic

❌ **Avoid for:**
- Components that always receive new props
- Trivial components with minimal render cost
- Components that rarely re-render

### When to Use useMemo
✅ **Use for:**
- Expensive computations
- Large JSX trees passed as props
- Derived values used in dependency arrays

❌ **Avoid for:**
- Simple primitive calculations
- Values that change on every render
- Premature optimization

### When to Use useCallback
✅ **Use for:**
- Event handlers passed to memoized children
- Functions used in dependency arrays
- Functions passed to third-party libraries

❌ **Avoid for:**
- Functions not passed as props
- Functions in non-performance-critical paths

## Monitoring Performance

### React DevTools Profiler
1. Install React DevTools browser extension
2. Open Profiler tab
3. Record interaction
4. Analyze component render times and counts

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Render count**: Should decrease for memoized components
- **Render duration**: Should remain stable or decrease
- **Committed changes**: Should be minimal for unchanged components

### Performance Regression Detection
Watch for:
- Increased render counts after state changes
- Memoized components re-rendering unnecessarily
- Growing dependency arrays (may indicate over-optimization)

## Future Optimizations

### Potential Improvements
1. **Code splitting**: Lazy load report components
2. **Virtual scrolling**: For long option lists
3. **Web Workers**: Offload heavy computations
4. **Suspense boundaries**: Better loading states

### Not Recommended
- Over-memoization of trivial components
- Premature optimization without profiling
- Complex memoization logic that reduces readability

## Version History
