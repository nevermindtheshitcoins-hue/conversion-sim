# Product Overview

## Project Purpose
Conversion-Sim is an AI-powered site visitor conversion tool. User will answer 3 preliminary questions to set the basic scene for their DeVote Use-Case simulation (i). An API call si then made (OPENAI with fallback to Gemini) sending the preliminary question details to an AI. The AI then responds with a set of 5 further dynamic question and answer sets. These must thern be parsed and split, the user answers them, and again, the details are sent to an Ai via API call. Using the details from the whole set of questions, the AI will generate a fictional news report in which DeVote was used in their custom scenario (like a simulation). The user will then be able to save the report, and will be enticed with custome CTA to book an appointment.
